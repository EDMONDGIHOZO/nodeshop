# nodeshop

simple node js application, with only four models , (Product, order, cart and user).
and i have done the user authentication routes with middleware that can be used for authrization.

however , some more important features are still missing
like : content validation before saving to the database, payment , etc.

## to run this app:

** clone
** cd dir
** yarn
** create .env file with (MONGO_URL, PORT, SECRET_KEY,JWT_KEY)
** npm run dev

that's all.
